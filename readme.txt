How It Works:

Essentially this Daily Fantasy Sports plugins turns any WordPress site into a Daily Fantasy Sports game, where site owners can offer a professional Daily Fantasy Sports game to their sites visitors.  Visitors predict the winners of upcoming sports games and earn points for each correct selection. The user with the most points at the end when all the fixtures have been played is declared the winner.  Version 2 of this plugin will feature player drafts where users can earn points based on individual player performance.

All the upcoming game schedules, game scores, game updates and player stats are all included in the price of the plugin.  Just the stats alone are worth thousands of dollars per month. This plugin handles all that.  Plus it tracks all the picks submitted by the users and updates all the users points, declared the winners and sends our email notifications.  Plus it also allows the site admin to create their own pool with custom teams, players and fixtures.

 
Front End Features

Lobby Block: This is a list of games that users can enter. Table headings show entry fee of each game and the total payout. It also displays the amount of players that have entered as well as the size of the pool. Of course it shows the time and date when the pool starts. There is also a very use to use search tool where users can narrow down their search for a specific contest to play.
Create Contest Page: When a user clicks on Create Contest, they will be presented with a page of options that allow full customization of their league.  The site admin has complete control on what options are offered to users.  Leagues last just one day.  
The user can select the sport, date of pool and even the fixtures they want to be part of their pool. They will select if it is a FREE practice game or if the game has an entry fee. They can also select the pool size. It can be a size of 2, which makes it head-to-head or a bigger size to allow for more participants.
The game type defines what game to play. This is where you can offer Fan Victor's standard game types or have us build you a custom game type.
Pick Selection Page: Once a user creates a contest, they are presented with the Pick Submission page. This is the page where the users enter their picks or draft their team for their contest.  Games can be based on a salary cap or non-salary cap for Player Draft games.  For custom games, we can create any input page needed for your custom game.
Live Rankings Page: Welcome to Fantasy Sports Heaven. After users have entered their picks, they are sent to the Live Rankings page. This page is a summary of their selections. Once the pool has started, users will NO longer be able to edit their picks and will be allowed to view other users picks.   So you can watch alongside your favourite sport and watch yourself climb up the leaderboard and claim victory!
This page is updated according to Fan Victor stats engine technology.  Fan Victor strives try to make it as real-time as possible. However,  you can integrate other statistical vendors to our plugin.  Please contact us for details.
My Contests Page: This page lists all the games a users has entered. This includes past history games, future games and live games. A user can click on any game to view the history if the game is over or view the upcoming game details and picks.
Transaction History: End users can always get to their transaction history to view all the payments, withdrawals and games fees they initiated. Always kept up to date in real-time.
Add Payment: End users will be able to purchase credits via an easy form they fill in using your websites default payment gateway.
Payment Request: End users can request a withdrawal at any time. The site admin will be notified via email.
Credit System: This ultimate plugin comes with a built-in credit system that integrates with your website payment gateway. So you can define the cost of credits to purchase and the cost of credits to withdrawal. It integrates with your default payment gateway seamlessly. Users use credits to play in paid games. These are games that have an entry fee to join. It also includes a fully functional admin reporting section for site administrators so you know exactly just how much money you're making.
Back End Features:
Settings: Fully customize which sports you want to support on your site. Choose one, some or all of them: Football (Pro and College), Basketball (Pro and College), Soccer, Baseball, Hockey, Golf, Nascar and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA).
Select the site rake percentage. As a site owner, you can make money by defining a cost to purchase or withdraw credits AND/OR you can define what your rake is per pool. Standard rake is 10%. But we'll leave that up to you to decide. Its VERY flexible!
Manage withdrawal requests with a simple table where withdrawal requests are listed. Site admins will be able to approve payments right from the adminCP. How convenient is that?!?!
Get up to the minute reports on deposits and withdrawals. You'll always know exactly how much money you're making. We'll even show you site statistics so you can keep track of how users are playing.
